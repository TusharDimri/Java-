Classes and interfaces have first lette of their name capital(they follow camel casing):  Calc, MyData
Variables and methods have small letter (for multiple words we follow camel casing) - marks, show()    
Constants have all capital letters - PIE, BRAND       


Camel Casing (preferred in Java):
showMyMarks() : first letter of each word is capital from second word
