Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class.

Why do we need Inheritance?

Inheritance helps to:

Promote code reuse: By inheriting the common attributes and methods from a parent class, we can avoid duplicating code in multiple classes.
Establish a hierarchy: Inheritance helps to create a hierarchy of classes, where a child class inherits the properties and behavior of a parent class, and can also add new features or override existing ones.
Improve modularity: Inheritance enables us to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable classes, each with its own specific responsibilities.
